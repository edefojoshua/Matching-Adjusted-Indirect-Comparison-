Matching Adjusted Indirect Comparison and the different steps

```{r c}
# Step 1: Prepare your data
# Example of individual patient data (IPD) from study A
ipd_data <- data.frame(
  age = c(45, 60, 52, 38, 50, 62),
  sex = c(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0),  # 1 = Male, 0 = Female
  outcome = c(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)  # Binary outcome (e.g., response to treatment)
)

# Example of aggregate data from study B (e.g., summary statistics for age and sex)
aggregate_summarised_data <- list(
  mean_age = 50,       # Mean age in study B
  prop_male = 0.6      # Proportion of males in study B
)

# Step 2: Calculate Weights Using Logistic Regression
# Center the covariates by subtracting the study B mean and proportion
ipd_data$age_centered <- ipd_data$age - aggregate_summarised_data$mean_age
ipd_data$sex_centered <- ipd_data$sex - aggregate_summarised_data$prop_male

# Fit logistic regression model to estimate the weights
logit_model <- glm(rep(1, nrow(ipd_data)) ~ age_centered + sex_centered, 
                   family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = ipd_data)

# Calculate weights as the inverse of the predicted probabilities
ipd_data$weights <- 1 / fitted(logit_model)

# Step 3: Apply Weights and Calculate Weighted Outcome
# Compare outcomes between the weighted IPD data and study B
# Calculate weighted mean outcome in the IPD study
weighted_mean_outcome <- svymean(~outcome, design = svydesign(~1, data = ipd_data, weights = ~weights))
weighted_mean <- coef(weighted_mean_outcome)  # Extract the weighted mean
weighted_variance <- attr(weighted_mean_outcome, "var")  # Extract the variance

# Step 4: Compare with Aggregate Study B Outcome
# Example reported outcome and variance from Study B
aggregate_outcome <- 0.65  # Mean outcome in study B
aggregate_variance <- 0.0025  # Variance for the comparator outcome

# Calculate the treatment difference
treatment_difference <- weighted_mean - aggregate_outcome
treatment_difference

# Calculate the combined variance (assuming outcomes are independent)
combined_variance <- weighted_variance + aggregate_variance

# Compute the standard error (SE)
SE <- sqrt(combined_variance)

# Calculate 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference
CI_lower <- treatment_difference - 1.96 * SE
CI_lower
CI_upper <- treatment_difference + 1.96 * SE
CI_upper

# Print results
cat("Weighted Outcome (IPD):", weighted_mean, "\n")
cat("Aggregate Outcome (Study B):", aggregate_outcome, "\n")
cat("Treatment Difference:", treatment_difference, "\n")
cat("95% Confidence Interval:", CI_lower, "to", CI_upper, "\n")
